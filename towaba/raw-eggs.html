        <p>Enjoy our most popular item on the breakfast menu: raw eggs. Handpicked from the chicken coop behind our restaurant, these eggs provide you with a healthy start to your morning. We take pride in making sure you are served these eggs in the most natural way possible, so we don't bother to wash, refrigerate, or even cook these eggs. In fact, you get to crack them open yourself. What's more, this entree comes with no plate, so you get to pour the yoke straight into your mouth. However, it is important to know that consuming these eggs may give you salmonella. For a boost in taste, try these eggs with our wonderful Tobawa sauce.</p>
